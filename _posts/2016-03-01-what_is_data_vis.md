In 2016 I got the opportunity to speak in front of a small group of highschoolers who were part of the [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) group at Ingraham High School. Though we were interrupted by a power outage, I did my best to talk through my (always expanding) ideas about the point and power of data visualization.

Thanks very much to [Erin Shellman](http://www.erinshellman.com/) for the invite!
